## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1

This lab has a special place in my heart because it was the first and to me it's always the most important because it introduces me to new ideas and concepts and in this case with no experience on github and linux, it did exactly that. We learned how to join a group and use/clone the repository along with the basic git commands like clone, add, commit, and others like push. I never had much coding experience to begin with, so doing the authors.md was also cool to me because it's like writing your name on a paper, however it's more of your information in order to show you and your partners did that coding. 

Lab 5, part 1

After learning how to do the other basics and after some finished and unfinished labs this was one of the labs that kind of stuck out to me because it's about calculating the area of a rectangle and we can easily just do something like that in our heads so it was easier to put into perspective. In this lab we needed to make full use of our understanding of those simple facts and use code like cout, cin, and int in order to use our equation int RectangleArea(int length, int width) to find the area. At the time it was very complex to me but I was able to understand code better thanks to this lab. 

Lab 7

This lab was among my favorites because the topic might have been boring as it was about parking times but the code we used was definitely one that slowly grew on me the more we used it. We used a lot of if(else) statements that ment using and/or. We had to decipher when a parking time was restricted and when you were allowed to park there in order to automate those times and rules. We also had to mark down when those rules end in this case it ended at the minute (1:59) and allowed the else/parking to start again at the beginning of the said hour (2:00) of course we also had to keep track of things like the days, AM/PM, and where it was taking place it shows how much code in needed for something you wouldn't look at more than needed.
